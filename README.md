# Strong Password Generator
**Strong Password Generator is a simple Python UI tool to generate random strong passwords.**
It can create passwords using several special characters, letters and numbers, from 6 characters to 300 characters long.

## Code inside
The Python program inside uses three librairies to work : [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html), [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) and [pyperclip](https://pyperclip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
It has been compiled and turned into an exe. You can install it with the provided Installer, or use the [raw version](). Make sure to download the icon file if you use the raw program.

## How to use it
The program will take one number between 6 (excluded) and 300 (included), representing the amount of characters that will be generated.

You can after press "Generate". A password will be generated using different characters, from letters to special characters.

## How to download

You can download the Installer (exe) [here](https://github.com/BloodAlibi/Strong_Password_Generator/tree/main/Strong_Password_Generator/Installer_exe) to install it. If you wish to avoid Installers, you can still download the raw version (exe) with all its required files [here](https://github.com/BloodAlibi/Strong_Password_Generator/tree/main/Strong_Password_Generator/Original_exe).
You may also download the Python file and run it.
MacOS and Linux require the raw [Python file](https://github.com/BloodAlibi/Strong_Password_Generator/tree/main/Strong_Password_Generator/Source).
